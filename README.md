# 🚀 Gemini PDF Chat

## 📚 Introduction

Gemini PDF Chat is an innovative application that allows users to interact with and query multiple PDF documents using natural language. Powered by Google's Gemini Pro language model and leveraging advanced NLP techniques, this tool provides an intuitive interface for extracting insights from your PDFs.

This project serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate the potential of combining Large Language Models with document processing for interactive querying.

## 🌟 Features

- 📄 Upload and process multiple PDF documents
- 🔍 Extract and index text content from PDFs
- 💬 Natural language querying of document content
- 🧠 Intelligent responses generated by Gemini Pro LLM
- 🖥️ User-friendly Streamlit interface
- 🔬 Research notebook for advanced experimentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Conda (for environment management)
- NVIDIA GPU (for research notebook)

### 🌿 Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuyodhanJ6/PDFChat-Gemini-LangChain.git
   cd PDFChat-Gemini-LangChain
   ```

2. Create a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -p ./venv python=3.10 -y
   ```

3. Activate the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate ./venv
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 🔑 Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run gemini_pdf_chat_frontend.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Usage

1. Upload one or more PDF documents using the file uploader in the sidebar.
2. Click the "Process" button to extract and index the content.
3. Enter your questions in the text input field.
4. View the AI-generated responses based on the content of your PDFs.

## 🔬 Research Notebook

For advanced users and researchers, we provide a Jupyter notebook in the `research` folder. This notebook allows for deeper experimentation and analysis.

### Running the Research Notebook

1. Navigate to the research folder:
   ```bash
   cd research
   ```

2. Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the research notebook and run the cells as needed.

### Monitoring GPU Usage

After running the notebook, it's important to check GPU usage and terminate processes if necessary:

1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```

2. Check the GPU usage in the output. It should look similar to this:

   ![NVIDIA SMI Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuyodhanJ6/PDFChat-Gemini-LangChain/main/flowchart/nvidia_smi.png)

3. If you need to terminate a process using the GPU, find its process ID (PID) in the nvidia-smi output, then use the kill command:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

   Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID you want to terminate.

4. Run `nvidia-smi` again to confirm the process has been terminated and GPU resources have been freed.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

As a Proof of Concept, this project demonstrates the core functionality of PDF chatting using Gemini Pro. However, there are several areas where it can be improved and expanded:

1. **Memory Optimization**: Implement more efficient memory management to handle larger documents and longer conversations.

2. **Concurrent Request Handling**: Enhance the backend to process multiple user requests simultaneously for improved scalability.

3. **Vector Database Optimization**: Implement advanced indexing and querying techniques to improve retrieval speed and accuracy.

4. **User Interface Enhancements**: Develop a more interactive and user-friendly interface with features like document highlighting and chat history.

5. **Multi-language Support**: Extend the capability to process and respond to queries in multiple languages.

6. **Document Preprocessing**: Implement more robust PDF parsing to handle complex layouts, tables, and images.

7. **Fine-tuning**: Explore fine-tuning the Gemini Pro model on domain-specific data for improved performance in specialized use cases.

8. **Caching Mechanism**: Implement a caching system to store frequent queries and their results for faster response times.

9. **Security Enhancements**: Add more robust security measures for handling sensitive documents and user data.

10. **API Development**: Create a RESTful API to allow integration with other applications and services.

We welcome contributions and ideas to help evolve this PoC into a more robust and feature-rich application!
